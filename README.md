# AshaIV: My Portfolio Website

This is Asha Ivey's portfolio website with details about her and the projects she has worked on. 

## Development Workflow
To test the website locally, you would need credentials for a service account with Google Cloud Datastore. You would need to set the credentials in the terminal:

> export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

You also need to make sure that Flask knows where your app code is. You need to specify the file name of the flask app:

> export FLASK_APP=main
